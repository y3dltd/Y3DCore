// This file can be used for shared authentication utilities or constants if needed.
// For now, it's minimal after removing mock auth.

// Password hashing functions are imported directly where needed or from:
// src/lib/server-only/auth-password.ts

// Example: Exporting authOptions if needed elsewhere (though often imported directly)
// export { authOptions } from '@/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route';
