## eBay Personalization Extraction

### Issue
The system was incorrectly extracting personalization text from eBay order notes, causing orders to be unnecessarily marked for review.

### Fix
Improved the `extractEbayPersonalizationData` function to:
- Correctly parse eBay customer notes format
- Extract complete personalization blocks (item ID, color, text)
- Match the correct personalization block to each product based on item ID and color
- Handle cases where the text value is on the same line as the "Text:" label

### Result
eBay orders with clear personalization data are now processed correctly without being marked for review unnecessarily.

## Quantity Mismatch Handling

### Issue
When there was a quantity mismatch in orders (OrderQty > ParsedTotalQty), the system would only create tasks for the parsed quantity, causing incomplete order processing.

### Fix
Modified the order processing logic to:
- Create tasks for the full order quantity even when personalization data is incomplete
- Mark these tasks for review with appropriate annotations
- Preserve existing text values when possible

### Result
Orders with quantity mismatches now have the correct number of tasks created and are properly marked for review, ensuring all ordered items are accounted for.

## Status Synchronization

### Issue
Order and task statuses in the database sometimes became out of sync with ShipStation, leading to tasks remaining in 'pending' or 'in_progress' state even after orders were shipped or cancelled.

### Fix
Implemented a status synchronization mechanism that:
- Checks for mismatches between ShipStation order status and database order status
- Updates the database to match ShipStation
- Automatically updates related print tasks to the appropriate status

### Result
Order and task statuses are now correctly synchronized, ensuring that shipped or cancelled orders have their tasks properly marked as completed or cancelled.

## STL Render Status Fixes

### Issue
The `PrintOrderTask` table contained invalid `stl_render_state` values (empty strings or nulls), and some tasks were stuck in 'running' state.

### Fix
Implemented fixes to:
- Update empty or null `stl_render_state` values to 'pending'
- Reset tasks stuck in 'running' state to 'pending'
- Fix tasks with status 'in_progress' but completed STL paths

### Result
STL render status values are now valid and consistent, preventing runtime errors and ensuring the render process works correctly.

## Utility Scripts

### Issue
Multiple separate scripts were used for debugging and fixing issues, making it difficult to maintain and use them efficiently.

### Fix
Consolidated all utility scripts into a single, comprehensive `order-utils.ts` script with multiple commands:
- `find`: Find orders with quantity mismatches
- `fix`: Fix an order with quantity mismatches
- `show`: Show detailed information about an order
- `reprocess`: Reprocess an order
- `fix-status`: Fix status mismatches
- `fix-stl`: Fix STL render status issues
- `check-tasks`: Check task status statistics
- `batch-reprocess`: Reprocess multiple orders in a batch

### Result
A single, easy-to-use utility script that provides comprehensive functionality for managing orders and fixing common issues.

## OpenAI API Mocking

### Issue
Development and testing environments were making real OpenAI API calls, incurring unnecessary costs.

### Fix
Disabled real OpenAI API calls in development and testing environments:
- Added mock data for print-queue-summary.ts
- Added mock data for print-plan.ts

### Result
Development and testing can now be done without incurring OpenAI API costs.

## Data Customization Priority

### Clarification
The Y3DHub system extracts customization data from different marketplaces in this priority:
1. Etsy: from print_settings
2. Amazon: first from CustomizedURL, then print_settings
3. eBay: from customer notes

The system uses AI processing in all cases to extract and refine customization data.

## Usage Examples

### Finding and Fixing eBay Orders with Quantity Mismatches
```bash
# Find orders with quantity mismatches
npx tsx src/scripts/order-utils.ts find

# Fix a specific order
npx tsx src/scripts/order-utils.ts fix 14-13017-08187

# Verify the fix
npx tsx src/scripts/order-utils.ts show 14-13017-08187
```

### Fixing Status Mismatches
```bash
# Check for status mismatches (dry run)
npx tsx src/scripts/order-utils.ts fix-status

# Fix status mismatches for a specific order
npx tsx src/scripts/order-utils.ts fix-status --order-id 14-13017-08187 --fix

# Fix status mismatches for all orders
npx tsx src/scripts/order-utils.ts fix-status --fix
```

### Checking and Fixing Task Status Issues
```bash
# Check task status statistics
npx tsx src/scripts/order-utils.ts check-tasks

# Fix STL render status issues
npx tsx src/scripts/order-utils.ts fix-stl
```

### Batch Processing Orders
```bash
# Reprocess multiple orders from a specific marketplace
npx tsx src/scripts/order-utils.ts batch-reprocess --marketplace ebay --limit 10

# Reprocess orders with a specific status
npx tsx src/scripts/order-utils.ts batch-reprocess --status pending --limit 10
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced AI Processing**: Further improve AI processing for extracting personalization data from customer notes across all marketplaces.

2. **Automated Status Synchronization**: Implement a scheduled job to automatically synchronize order and task statuses with ShipStation.

3. **Improved Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling and reporting for order processing failures.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize database queries and processing logic for better performance with large order volumes.

5. **User Interface Improvements**: Add a web interface for the utility functions to make them more accessible to non-technical users.
