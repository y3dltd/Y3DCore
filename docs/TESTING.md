# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Y3DHub project.

## Overview

We aim for a comprehensive testing approach covering different levels:

1.  **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions, modules, and components in isolation.
2.  **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between different parts of the system (e.g., API endpoints and database).
3.  **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Test user flows through the application interface.
4.  **Script Tests**: Test the functionality of command-line scripts.

## Tools and Frameworks

- **Unit/Integration Tests**: [Jest, Vitest, etc.]
- **E2E Tests**: [Cypress, Playwright, etc.]
- **Assertion Library**: [Jest expect, Chai, etc.]
- **Mocking**: [Jest mocks, Sinon.JS, etc.]

## Test Coverage

- We aim for high test coverage, particularly for critical business logic (`src/lib`) and utility functions.
- Coverage reports will be generated regularly.

## Running Tests

- **All Tests**: `npm test` or `yarn test`
- **Unit Tests**: `npm run test:unit`
- **Integration Tests**: `npm run test:integration`
- **E2E Tests**: `npm run test:e2e`

[Update commands based on the chosen testing framework.]

## Writing Tests

- Follow standard testing practices (Arrange-Act-Assert).
- Write clear and descriptive test names.
- Keep tests independent and focused.
- Use mocking effectively to isolate units.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

- Tests will be run automatically in the CI pipeline on every push/pull request.
- Build failures will occur if tests fail.
