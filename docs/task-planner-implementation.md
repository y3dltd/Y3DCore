# Y3DHub Task Planner Implementation

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Type Errors

- Updated Prisma type in `/app/api/ai/reports/[id]/run/route.ts` to correctly handle null values with `Prisma.JsonNull`
- Fixed TypeScript errors in planner components to ensure type safety

### 2. Enhanced AI Planner System Prompt

- Updated the system prompt in `/app/api/ai/reports/planner/route.ts` with detailed instructions
- Added specific optimization goals:
  - Minimize total tasks
  - Maximize items per task
  - Ensure efficient color grouping (max 4 colors per task)
  - Preserve personalization data
- Improved JSON output format with task sequence structure

### 3. Updated Task UI Components

- Modified `PrintTaskCard` to match the requested format:
  - Added "Colors to Load" section at the top
  - Reformatted task items to show quantity, colors, and personalization text in a cleaner layout
  - Improved visual separation between sections
  
### 4. Created Database-Driven Planner

- Created `/api/print-tasks` endpoint to fetch pending print tasks from the database
- Created `/api/print-tasks/optimize` endpoint to optimize tasks using the AI planner
- Updated the planner page to automatically fetch tasks without manual input
- Added stats panel showing task counts and status
- Implemented optimization button to generate optimized task groups
- Added refresh functionality to update task data

### 5. Added Navigation Support

- Added redirect from `/ai/planner` to `/planner` for consistent URL structure

### 6. Documentation

- Created detailed enhancement plan in `/docs/planner-enhancement-plan.md`
- Added implementation details for reference

## Completed Optimization Features

1. **Automatic Data Loading**
   - Planner now automatically loads print tasks from the database
   - No manual input required - tasks are fetched and displayed immediately

2. **Task Optimization**
   - Optimized grouping based on color requirements
   - Respects the 4-color-per-task limit
   - Preserves personalization text
   - Displays optimized results separately from original tasks

3. **Enhanced UI**
   - Statistics panel showing task counts and status
   - Error handling with clear messages
   - Automatic refresh capability
   - Toggle between optimized and original task views

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test with real print task data from the production database
   - Verify optimization algorithms against real-world requirements
   - Performance testing with large task volumes

2. **User Workflow Improvements**
   - Add ability to apply optimized task groupings back to the database
   - Add filtering options (by color, due date, etc.)
   - Implement batch actions for print tasks

## Usage Instructions

### Automatic Task Planning

1. Navigate to `/planner`
2. Tasks are automatically loaded from the database
3. Click "Optimize Tasks" to generate optimized task groupings
4. View detailed statistics about task counts and status
5. Use the "Refresh Tasks" button to update with latest database changes

### Task Card Format

The enhanced task card now shows:

- Task ID and order information
- Colors to load (aggregated from all items)
- Individual print tasks with:
  - Quantity
  - Color requirements (visual chips)
  - Personalization text
  - Item details

### Development Notes

The system uses Next.js App Router for navigation and API routes. The planner optimization flow:

1. `/api/print-tasks` loads pending tasks from the database
2. When optimization is requested, `/api/print-tasks/optimize` calls the OpenAI API
3. Results are displayed in the enhanced UI components
4. All tasks automatically use the new PrintTaskCard format
